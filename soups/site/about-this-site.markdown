This site is powered by {l vanilla-rb}, a software experiment of mine. I think it's pretty neat.

Basically it's an attempt to make a site in a {l homoiconicity,homoiconic} way, i.e. where the lines between content and structure blur as much as possible. Pretty much everything is composed from fundamental building blocks called {l snip,snips}, which can evaluate as either content, or processing, or a mixture of both.

It might not work, but it's an interesting experiment. I wrote a {l introducing-vanilla-rb,blog post} about it, which might be of interest.

You can learn about how the site actually runs {l "how interblah works",here}.
