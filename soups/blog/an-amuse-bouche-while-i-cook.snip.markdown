An amuse bouche while I’m preparing the rest of the menu
=======================================

I’ve been thinking a lot about the things going on in the Ruby community at the
moment.

I’ve been trying to tease them out into separate threads where possible:

* the Ruby Central situation with RubyGems;
* the demise of RailsConf vs the rise of Rails World;
* the growing schisms in our community spaces (X vs Mastodon/BlueSky, Discord
  vs... Discord);
* and last but by no means least, the impact DHH’s personal blog & politics are
  having on our community.

... and although I realise that they are not entirely separate, I have to try
and think about them separately to have any hope of figuring out what I believe,
and how that should inform the choices I make.

I’m working on probably several posts about those things, but while doing
research, I found something that I thought was worth sharing.

<!-- excerpt -->

David’s personal blog is, unsurprisingly, a mingling of this thoughts on
technology and, increasingly, opinions about politics, culture, health,
demographics, and many other issues.

His post about London -- which I find **extremely problematic** to say the
least[^racist], and is will be one of the main topics of a future post here, I
hope -- is what inspired me to actually pay closer attention to some of the
other things he’s written about in the past.

I’ve long understood that our personal views about many things were diverging,
but since he seems to be at least reading books or citing sources, even though I
might’ve disagreed with his arguments or conclusions, at least they seemed to be
actual _arguments_ instead of just, say, the edgy hot-takes of an increasingly
radicalised anti-woke millionaire dressed up as insight.

But then I dug in a little.

## Read the citations

Here’s a quote from his post “Building competency is better than therapy”, in
which he argues that there’s deep fulfilment available from hard work and focus
(probably true!) and perhaps that’s what most people need instead of talk
therapy or medication (we’ll see).

[study2]: https://bjsm.bmj.com/content/57/18/1203

He’s got citations for the assertion that “exercise is a more effective
treatment that therapy or drugs”, which give the effect of lending weight to the
assertion, but I actually _looked_ at those studies, and... well, look:

Let me pull out the important parts for you:

1. **“only one study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. As a
   result, confidence [...] was low for walking or jogging and very low for
   other treatments.”** Cochrane is the gold standard for performing
   meta-analyses across multiple studies. What this means is that these studies
   are low quality, and confidence of the results is accordingly low.
2. **“These forms of exercise could be considered alongside psychotherapy and
   antidepressants as core treatments for depression.”** You read it right:
   _alongside_.

Nowhere in the abstract for this study does it suggest that exercise is _better_
than talk therapy or medications. Certainly the study does not suggest using
them as an _alternative_.

Maybe the second one will support David’s point instead:

> ### Effectiveness of physical activity interventions for improving depression, anxiety and distress: an overview of systematic reviews
>
> **Results**: Results Ninety-seven reviews (1039 trials and 128 119
> participants) were included. Populations included healthy adults, people with
> mental health disorders and people with various chronic diseases. Most reviews

> size=−0.43, IQR=−0.66 to –0.27), anxiety (median effect size=−0.42, IQR=−0.66
> to –0.26) and psychological distress (effect size=−0.60, 95% CI −0.78 to
> –0.42), compared with usual care across all populations. The largest benefits

> adult populations, including the general population, people with diagnosed

> psychological distress.

I’ll save you some work and pull out the key points again:

**“Most reviews [...] had a critically low A MeaSurement Tool to Assess
systematic Reviews score.”.**

I hadn’t head of “A MeaSurement Tool”, so I had to ask AI about this. In the
spirit of fairness I asked the AI most likely to be sympathetic with David’s perspective[^grok] and [here’s what it
said](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtNQ%3D%3D_58d95e03-b035-47ff-a186-fad345c36695):


> The sentence "Most reviews (n=77) had a critically low A MeaSurement Tool to
> Assess systematic Reviews score." means that the majority of the 97 systematic
> reviews included in this umbrella review were judged to be of very poor
> methodological quality.

And guess what -- again, nowhere does the study conclude that exercise is
_better_ than therapy or medical interventions for depression, nor that they
should be considered as a replacement.

## Pointless assertions

I don’t mean to seize on this particular post of David’s to say “Gotcha! You are
wrong!”. I almost laugh at myself, spending all this time because “someone is
wrong on the internet!” Oh James, you sweet summer child.

No, I’ve written this, is because I think it’s a good illustration of how
individual opinions can be dressed up with selective citation and important
sounding sentences to give the _appearance_ of insight.

I’m not disputing that many people might benefit from exercise to help their
mental health, nor with -- assuming best intentions -- David’s assertion that
many people would feel their days improved via hard work and focus on something
they can really invest it.

But there’s **no reason** to couple those uncontroversial ideas with the
assertions that therapy and medication are less effective, or even
inappropriate. It’s not supported by the studies he cites, but more importantly,
asserting those baseless “facts” isn’t even necessary to make the point he cares
about. **Why bother?**

## Share your actual experience

Has he had negative experiences with either therapy or medication, irst-hand or
otherwise? If so, he could write about that, I think that would be really
interesting, and personal experience is _always_ valid. [Here’s a great
example](https://www.schneems.com/2024/11/21/my-red-hot-adhd-programming-affliction/)
from Richard Schneeman -- co-incidentally refuting a similar hot-take from David
about ADHD.

But I am not sure David has experience of either depression _or_
therapy/medication. Nor, I suspect, does he have any experience as a minority,
or as neuro-atypical, or someone who’s even slightly overweight, or as the
parent of a girl[^girl], or so many other aspects of existence that fall outside
of his personal experience. But that doesn’t stop him writing about them as if,
just because he’s done a bit of selective reading, he’s acheived some insight
and can bring his New Wisdom down from Millionaire Mountain for the rest of us
to benefit from.

So many of David’s non-technical posts are written in this way, making some kind
of proclamation, seemingly backed up by research or reading, and yet now I
wonder, how much of that is just scaffolding constructed to prop up an opinion
or intuition that he already had, and just wanted to justify.

Look... I’m getting worked up. As Tom said, he’s just one man, with one man’s experience. That’s the human condition, after all!

But, as I hope to get to in a later post, when you’re the leader of a community,
I think you have to hold yourself to a higher standard than just any old dude on
the internet firing their dressed-up reckons out into an echo chamber of
sychophantic back slappers. Oops, I mean: X.

I think DHH has great taste in software. I have done, and continue to benefit
greatly from his Open Source gifts. I’ve had constructive disagreements with him
in the past, always respectful. He’s even told me, on one rare occasion, that he
was wrong! That kind of humility would be a breath of fresh air.

But despite saying “[whoever shows up is
welcome](https://x.com/dhh/status/1976230666414223443)”, his personal politics
are becoming increasingly hard to ignore. There’s a bitter irony in his ban of
politics at his own place of work, while yet he doesn’t recognise that, because
of his position in our community, when we work with Rails we are _all_ his
colleagues in this community space, and his amplified position makes it almost
impossible to filter out his own politics.

Anyway. I’ve more to say about that, but it’s for another time. Soon I hope.

## Not every thought needs to be framed as counter to another

I guess I should wrap this up. I only wanted to make a small point.

When you’re making some point, you don’t have to frame it as a counterpoint to
something else. 

Maybe exercise and building competency can be good _without_ diminishing the
value of talk therapy or medication. 

Maybe the same cultural “ideals” don’t apply to both Cophenhagen and London.

Maybe there’s lots of ways to live life, and maybe we should spend a bit less
time trying to invalidate the experiences of others, and a bit more time
listening, practicing humility, and thinking about our privileges and biases
instead.

[^grok]: In direct comparisons between Grok and Claude, I found them to have
    wildly different biases. But when Grok is asked to consider more deeply, it
    revises its opinions to agree with Claude. See, for example, [this take by Grok](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtNQ%3D%3D_584b3154-e08b-456f-a3b5-cce3b872d14a) on DHH’s London post, vs [this by Claude](https://claude.ai/share/ee965d5a-5322-46a3-999a-82bdb6def399). Grok’s initial response is very much aligned with the author, but asking the same questions rapidly turns it around.

[^girl]: Another future post seed. Being a parent is full of challenges no matter the cards you’re dealt, but if you’ve never been the parent of a girl, you’ve never had to face things like the inherent default male gender of toys, characters in books overwhelmingly being “he”, and the myriad other ways that girls and women are made secondary.

[^racist]: I believe there are points made in the post that are objectively racist, despite the lingustic dodges employeed.
