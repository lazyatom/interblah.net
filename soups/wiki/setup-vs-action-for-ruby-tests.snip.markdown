Setup vs. Action for Ruby tests
=========

## A WORK IN STAGNANT PROGRESS

I've been thinking about how to express behaviour in tests in a natural and fluid way. One problem I've noticed is that with the classes xUnit *setup -> test -> teardown* structure is that the `setup` often ends up doing more work than it perhaps should.

This forms some of the background behind my work on {l kintama}.

The `should_change` straw
-------------------------

I think a good example of this is the `should_change` macro that [shoulda][] used to provide. I'll quote from [their blog post][should-change-deprecation]:

> Consider this example of should_change:
>
>     context "updating a post" do
>       setup do
>         @post = Post.create(:title => "old")
>         put :update, :post => {:title => "new"}, :id => @post.to_param
>       end
>
>       should_change("the post title", :from => "old", :to => "new") { @post.title }
>     end

> This reads well and seems to be fairly straightforward. Sadly, this doesnâ€™t work because of how `should_change` works internally (hence the confusing part). It would actually need to be written like this:

>     context "given a post" do
>       setup do
>         @post = Post.create(:title => "old")
>       end
>
>       context "updating" do
>         setup do
>           put :update, :post => {:title => "new"}, :id => @post.to_param
>         end
>
>         should_change("the post title", :from => "old", :to => "new") { @post.title }
>       end
>     end
>
> The `@post` instance variable needs to be assigned a context above the context containing `should_change`. I told you it was confusing.

Basically, because `should_change` needs to know the state *before* the setup ran, you need to nest another content. It's not the worst thing in the work, but blurgh.

Anyway, the [shoulda][] authors declared this a smell and deprecated the method, while [I disagreed][should-change-deprecation-my-comment] because while I agreed that the mechanism was crufty, some of the conclusions they drew about the invalidity of testing *change* were a bit tenuous.


Structural flexibility
----------------------

Perhaps, I wondered, there was a better way of structuring the tests that would make it more natural to write tests including things like `should_change`? Surely *nesting* isn't the only bit of sugar we can sprinkle on "setup -> test -> teardown"?

The problem was that the tests above were conflating the "setup" with the "action" that was being tested. Perhaps they are different? The first idea that popped into my head was sketched like this:

{codeshould_change}

That seems to avoid the "ugly" nested context, and is simultaneously clearer about what we're actually interested in testing here.

So, combine this idea with a general frustration at the way that [test-unit][] works[^test-unit-logging] and a continued unwillingness to drink the [rspec][] koolaid[^rspec-koolaid], I did what it turns out a million other people have done, and started exploring my own test framework, {l kintama}.


Using `action` in controller tests
-----

But... some objections to `should_change` have nothing to do with the clunkiness of defining nested contexts. They, quite fairly, point out that it encourage (or is symptomatic of) state-based testing; poking into the database to see whether some value has changed. And often that is a code smell.

Perhaps the `should_change` aspect is a *red herring*.

What was really driving the exploration of `action` was avoiding repetitive tests where some parameters of some action were changing:

{codecontroller_test}

The `action` is called after all the (nested) setups for a test have run, but just before the test itself. We can log a user in, and set the attributes used in the action, or we can not log anyone in, and in each case write regular tests to describe how the object should behave.

I think this probably requires a bit of internalisation, but I like the clarity of declaring "*right, this is the specific thing that is under test right now, and here is how it should behave in various different situations*".


Next steps
----------

I want to explore using `action` in tests more; this almost certainly means using it in anger on an actual software project.


[^test-unit-logging]: I'd wanted more verbose logging of test runs for a long time, with nested printing of context and test names, to more quickly see which tests were failing while they were still running. Unfortunately, the way that [test-unit][] works behind the scenes makes this basically impossible. See [MonkeySpecDoc](http://jgre.org/2008/09/03/monkeyspecdoc/) for an example of an attempt which hits this limitation. Yes, [rspec][] does this.

[^rspec-koolaid]: Basically I didn't want to invest time learning the pseudo-english matcher language that was heralded as being the main benefit at [rspec][]'s inception (the marketing may have changed, I don't know). The term [BDD][] may have served a purpose once, but I'm not sure now. I don't care if I'm writing "tests" or "specs", I just care about being able to quickly express some behaviour. Oh, and everyone was complaining about new versions of rspec breaking APIs. Anyway, this is just context, it's not objective fact.
