Doom Emacs
=======

Available on [GitHub][].

Another configuration distribution for Emacs, combining Evil mode (for vim-style modal editing and keybindings) with which-key and a layers-style configuration.

It's "more opinionated", but some of those opinions seem a bit strange, and I do sometimes feel like the organisation of commands under {l spacemacs} is a bit more coherent.

But! It boots much faster.
