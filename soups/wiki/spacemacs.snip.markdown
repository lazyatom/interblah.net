Spacemacs
=====

Available on [GitHub]: https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs

A configuration distribution for Emacs, using evil-mode for vim-style editing and keybindings, along with mnemonic command structure all accessible by first hitting "space" (hence the name).

I wrote a fair bit about it here: {l getting-started-with-spacemacs}
